=============================

The R library <b>leastcostpath</b> provides the functionality to calculate Least Cost Paths, which are often, but not exclusively, used in archaeological research. This library can be used to apply multiple cost functions when approximating the difficulty of moving across a landscape, as well as incorporating traversal <i>across</i> slope. Furthermore, attraction/repulsion of landscape features can be incorporated within the Least Cost Path calculation.

This library also provides the functionality to calculate movement potential within a landscape through the implementation of From-Everywhere-to-Everywhere (FETE) (White and Barber, 2012), Cumulative Cost Paths (Verhagen, 2013), and Least Cost Path calculation within specified distance bands (Llobera, 2015). 

Lastly, the library provides functionality to validate the accuracy of computed Least Cost Paths relative to another path. 

This package is built on classes and functions provided in the R package gdistance (Van Etten, 2017).

#### Creation of Cost Surfaces

    library(leastcostpath)
    r <- raster::raster(system.file('external/maungawhau.grd', package = 'gdistance'))
        
    slope_cs <- create_slope_cs(r, cost_function = 'tobler')
    traverse_cs <- create_traversal_cs(r)
    final_cost_cs <- slope_cs * traverse_cs
    
    slope_cs_10 <- create_slope_cs(r, cost_function = 'tobler', max_slope = 10)
    final_cost_cs_10 <- slope_cs_10 * traverse_cs
    
#### Least Cost Path computation

    loc1 = cbind(2667670, 6479000)
    loc1 = sp::SpatialPoints(loc1)
 
    loc2 = cbind(2667800, 6479400)
    loc2 = sp::SpatialPoints(loc2)

    lcps <- create_lcp(cost_surface = final_cost_cs, origin = loc1, destination = loc2, directional = FALSE)
  
    plot(raster(final_cost_cs))
    plot(lcps[1,], add = T, col = "red") # location 1 to location 2
    plot(lcps[2,], add = T, col = "blue") # location 2 to location 1
    
#### Cost Corridors

    cc <- create_cost_corridor(final_cost_cs, loc1, loc2)
    
    plot(cc)
    plot(loc1, add = T)
    plot(loc2, add = T)
    
#### From-Everywhere-to-Everywhere Least Cost Paths

    locs <- sp::spsample(as(raster::extent(r), 'SpatialPolygons'),n=10,'regular')
    
    lcp_network <- create_FETE_lcps(cost_surface = final_cost_cs, locations = locs,
    cost_distance = FALSE, parallel = FALSE)
    
    plot(raster(final_cost_cs))
    plot(locs, add = T)
    plot(lcp_network, add = T)
    
#### Cumulative Cost Paths

    locs <- sp::spsample(as(raster::extent(r), 'SpatialPolygons'),n=1,'random')

    lcp_network <- create_CCP_lcps(cost_surface = final_cost_cs, location = locs, distance = 50,
    radial_points = 10, cost_distance = FALSE, parallel = FALSE)
    
    plot(raster(final_cost_cs))
    plot(locs, add = T)
    plot(lcp_network, add = T)
    
#### Banded Least Cost Paths

    locs <- sp::spsample(as(raster::extent(r), 'SpatialPolygons'),n=1,'random')

    lcp_network <- create_banded_lcps(cost_surface = final_cost_cs, location = locs, min_distance = 20,
    max_distance = 50, radial_points = 10, cost_distance = FALSE, parallel = FALSE)
    
    plot(raster(final_cost_cs))
    plot(locs, add = T)
    plot(lcp_network, add = T)

#### Least Cost Path Density

    cumulative_lcps <- create_lcp_density(lcps = lcp_network, raster = r, rescale = FALSE)

    plot(cumulative_lcps)
    
#### Least Cost Path Network

    locs <- sp::spsample(as(raster::extent(r), 'SpatialPolygons'),n=5,'regular')
    
    mat <- cbind(c(1, 4, 2, 1), c(2, 2, 4, 3))
    
    lcp_network <- create_lcp_network(slope_cs, locations = locs, 
    nb_matrix = mat, cost_distance = FALSE, parallel = FALSE)
    
#### Pipes!

    cost_surface <- create_slope_cs(r, cost_function = 'tobler') %>%
    "*" (create_traversal_cs(r)) %>%
    "*" (create_feature(raster = r, locations = loc1, x = seq(200, 1, length.out = 20))
    
    lcp <- cost_surface %>% 
    create_lcp(cost_surface = . loc1, loc2)
    
    cost_corridor <- cost_surface %>% 
    create_cost_corridor(., loc1, loc2)
    
    locs <- sp::spsample(as(extent(r), 'SpatialPolygons'),n=10,'regular')
    
    lcp_network <- cost_surface %>% 
    create_FETE_lcps(cost_surface = final_cost_cs, locations = locs,cost_distance = FALSE, parallel = FALSE)
