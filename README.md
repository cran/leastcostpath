=============================

The <b>leastcostpath</b> is built on the classes and functions provided in the R package gdistance (Van Etten, 2017).

**NOTE:** The R library <b>leastcostpath</b> requires the use of projected coordinate systems. The package does not account for geographic coordinate systems.

<b>leastcostpath</b> provides the functionality to calculate Least Cost Paths (LCPs) using numerous time- and energy-based cost functions that approximate the difficulty of moving across a landscape. Additional cost surfaces can be incorporated into the analysis via create_barrier_cs() or create_feature_cs().

<b>leastcostpath</b> also provides the functionality to calculate Stochastic Least Cost Paths (Pinto and Keitt, 2009), and Probabilistic Least Cost Paths (Lewis, 2020).

<b>leastcostpath</b> also provides the functionality to calculate movement potential within a landscape through the implementation of From-Everywhere-to-Everywhere (White and Barber, 2012), Cumulative Cost Paths (Verhagen 2013), and Least Cost Path calculation within specified distance bands (Llobera, 2015).

Lastly, <b>leastcostpath</b> provides the functionality to validate the accuracy of the computed Least Cost Path relative to another path via validate_lcp() (Goodchild and Hunter, 1997) and PDI_validation() (Jan et al. 1999).

Usage
--------

#### Creation of Cost Surfaces

    library(leastcostpath)
    r <- raster::raster(system.file('external/maungawhau.grd', package = 'gdistance'))
        
    slope_cs <- create_slope_cs(r, cost_function = 'tobler')
    slope_cs_10 <- create_slope_cs(r, cost_function = 'tobler', max_slope = 10)
    slope_cs_exagg <- create_slope_cs(r, cost_function = 'tobler', exaggeration = TRUE)
    
    distance_cs <- create_distance_cs(r, neighbours = 16)
    
#### Least Cost Path computation

    loc1 = cbind(2667670, 6479000)
    loc1 = sp::SpatialPoints(loc1)
 
    loc2 = cbind(2667800, 6479400)
    loc2 = sp::SpatialPoints(loc2)

    lcps <- create_lcp(cost_surface = slope_cs, origin = loc1, destination = loc2, directional = FALSE)
  
    plot(raster(slope_cs))
    plot(lcps[1,], add = T, col = "red") # location 1 to location 2
    plot(lcps[2,], add = T, col = "blue") # location 2 to location 1
    
#### Cost Corridors

    cc <- create_cost_corridor(slope_cs, loc1, loc2)
    
    plot(cc)
    plot(loc1, add = T)

#### From-Everywhere-to-Everywhere Least Cost Paths

    locs <- sp::spsample(as(raster::extent(r), 'SpatialPolygons'),n=10,'regular')
    
    lcp_network <- create_FETE_lcps(cost_surface = slope_cs, locations = locs,

    plot(raster(slope_cs))
    plot(locs, add = T)

#### Cumulative Cost Paths

    locs <- sp::spsample(as(raster::extent(r), 'SpatialPolygons'),n=1,'random')

    lcp_network <- create_CCP_lcps(cost_surface = slope_cs, location = locs, distance = 50,
    radial_points = 10, cost_distance = FALSE, parallel = FALSE)
    
    plot(raster(slope_cs))
    plot(locs, add = T)

#### Banded Least Cost Paths

    locs <- sp::spsample(as(raster::extent(r), 'SpatialPolygons'),n=1,'random')

    lcp_network <- create_banded_lcps(cost_surface = slope_cs, location = locs, min_distance = 20,

    plot(raster(slope_cs))
    plot(locs, add = T)
    plot(lcp_network, add = T)

#### Least Cost Path Density

    cumulative_lcps <- create_lcp_density(lcps = lcp_network, raster = r, rescale = FALSE)

    plot(cumulative_lcps)
    
#### Least Cost Path Network

    locs <- sp::spsample(as(raster::extent(r), 'SpatialPolygons'),n=5,'regular')

    lcps <- list()
    
    for (i in 1:n) {
    
    lcps[[i]] <- leastcostpath::create_lcp(cost_surface = leastcostpath::create_slope_cs(dem = leastcostpath::add_dem_error(dem = r, rmse = RMSE, size = "auto", vgm_model = "Sph"), cost_function = "tobler", neighbours = 16), origin = locs[1,], destination = locs[2,], directional = FALSE, cost_distance = TRUE)
    
    }

Common Errors
---------------

    Error in if (is.numeric(v) && any(v < 0)) { : 
    missing value where TRUE/FALSE needed
    
Error caused when trying to calculate a Least Cost Path using SpatialPoints outside of the Cost Surface Extent:
  
  1. Check SpatialPoints used in the LCP calculation coincide with Raster / Cost Surface
  
  2. Check coordinate system of the Raster/Cost Surface is the same as the SpatialPoints
  

    Error in get.shortest.paths(adjacencyGraph, indexOrigin, indexGoal):
    At structural_properties.c:4521 :
    Weight vector must be non-negative, Invalid value
    
Error caused when calculating a Least Cost Path using a  Cost Surface that contains negative values. Error due to Djikstra's algorithm requiring non-negative values:

  1. Check if there are negative values via: 
  
    
    quantile(*your_cost_surface*@transitionMatrix@x)
