\title{Calculate least cost paths from each location to all other locations.}
\usage{
create_FETE_lcps(
  cost_surface,
  locations,
  cost_distance = FALSE,
  parallel = FALSE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{cost_surface}{\code{TransitionLayer} (gdistance package). Cost surface to be used in Least Cost Path calculation}

\item{locations}{\code{SpatialPoints*} (sp package). Locations to calculate Least Cost Paths from and to}

\item{cost_distance}{\code{logical}. if TRUE computes total accumulated cost for each Least Cost Path. Default is FALSE}

\item{parallel}{\code{logical}. if TRUE the Least Cost Paths will be calculated in parallel. Number of Parallel socket clusters is total number of cores available minus 1. Default is FALSE}
}
\value{
\code{SpatialLinesDataFrame} (sp package). The resultant object contains least cost paths calculated from each location to all other locations
}
\description{
Calculates least cost paths from each location to all other locations (i.e. From Everywhere To Everywhere (FETE)). This is based on the method proposed by White and Barber (2012).
