\usage{
create_FETE_lcps(cost_surface, locations, cost_distance = FALSE,
  parallel = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{cost_surface}{\code{TransitionLayer} object (gdistance package). Cost surface to be used in Least Cost Path calculation.}

\item{locations}{\code{SpatialPoints}. Locations to calculate Least Cost Paths from and to.}

\item{cost_distance}{if TRUE computes total accumulated cost for each Least Cost Path. Default is FALSE.}

\item{parallel}{if TRUE, the Least Cost Paths will be calculated in parallel. Number of Parallel socket clusters is total number of cores available minus 1. Default is FALSE.}
}
\value{
\code{SpatialLinesDataFrame} (sp package). The resultant object contains least cost paths calculated from each location to all other locations.
}
\description{
Calculates least cost paths from each location to all other locations.
}
\details{
Computes least cost paths from each location to all other locations (i.e. From Everywhere To Everywhere (FETE)). This is based on the method proposed by White and Barber (2012).
