\title{create_lcp}
\usage{
create_lcp(cost_surface, origin, destination, directional = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{cost_surface}{\code{TransitionLayer} object (gdistance package). Cost surface to be used in Least Cost Path calculation.}

\item{origin}{\code{SpatialPoints} location from which the Least Cost Path is calculated. Only the first row is taken into account.}

\item{destination}{\code{SpatialPoints} location to which the Least Cost Path is calculated. Only the first row is taken into account.}

\item{directional}{if TRUE Least Cost Path calculated from origin to destination only. If FALSE Least Cost Path calculated from origin to destination and destination to origin. Default is FALSE.}
}
\value{
\code{SpatialLines} (sp package) or \code{list} of \code{SpatialLines} dependent on directional argument. The resultant object is the shortest route (i.e. least cost) between origin and destination using the supplied \code{TransitionLayer}.
}
\description{
Calculates Least Cost Path
}
\details{
Calculates the Least Cost Path from an origin location to a destination location. See details for more.
