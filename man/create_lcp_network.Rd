\usage{
create_lcp_network(
  cost_surface,
  locations,
  nb_matrix = NULL,
  cost_distance = FALSE,
  parallel = FALSE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{cost_surface}{\code{TransitionLayer} object (gdistance package). Cost surface to be used in Least Cost Path calculation.}

\item{locations}{\code{SpatialPoints}. Potential locations to calculate Least Cost Paths from and to.}

\item{nb_matrix}{\code{matrix}. 2 column matrix representing the index of origins and destinations to calculate least cost paths between.}

\item{cost_distance}{if TRUE computes total accumulated cost for each Least Cost Path. Default is FALSE.}

\item{parallel}{if TRUE, the Least Cost Paths will be calculated in parallel. Number of Parallel socket clusters is total number of cores available minus 1. Default is FALSE.}
}
\value{
\code{SpatialLinesDataFrame} (sp package). The resultant object contains least cost paths calculated from each origins and destinations as specified in the neighbour matrix.
}
\description{
Calculates least cost paths from origins and destinations
}
\details{
Computes least cost paths from each origins and destinations as specified in the neighbour matrix.

nb_matrix = cbind(c(1, 4, 2, 1), c(2, 2, 4, 3)), cost_distance = FALSE, parallel = FALSE)
